    <h2 id="leanpub-auto-data-sources-in-detail" class="section">Data sources in detail</h2>

    <p>A data source in Terraform is used to fetch data from a resource that is not managed by the current Terraform
        project, so that value can be used in the current Terraform project. You can sort of think of it as a read only
        resource that already exists. The object exists but you want to read some properties of that object for use in
        your project.</p>

    <p>Lets dive into an example. Create a new folder on disk, create a file called <code>main.tf</code> inside it and
        paste in the following code (or grab the code from the folder <code>data_source_example_01</code> in the samples
        repository):</p>

    <p>As you can see from the above project a data source block starts with the word <code>data</code>. The next word
        is the type of data source. We are using a <code>aws_s3_bucket</code> data source, which is used to look up an
        S3 bucket. After the data source type, we give the data source an identifier in this case <code>"bucket"</code>.
        The identifier is used to reference the data source inside the Terraform project. The data source block is then
        opened with a <code>{</code>. You then specify any properties you want Terraform to use to search for the
        resource. We are using the complete name of the S3 bucket we are looking for. You then close the data source
        block with <code>}</code>.</p>

    <p>Rather than creating the bucket as we did before this time we are referencing a bucket that already exists. So
        before you run the above project you will need to create an S3 bucket with the name that you specify inside the
        data block. In the example above the bucket would be called <code>kevholditch-already-exists</code>. Name the
        bucket anything you want but then paste the name into the <code>bucket</code> property in the data source.</p>

    <p>At the bottom of this project we are creating an AWS IAM policy which gives permissions to list the bucket that
        we looked up in the data source. There are a couple of new concepts in the <code>aws_iam_policy</code> resource
        that I want to introduce. The IAM policy itself is a multi line string enclosed in between
        <code>&lt;&lt;POLICY</code> and <code>POLICY</code>. This is how you define a multi line string in Terraform.
        You open the multi line string with <code>&lt;&lt;</code> then you place any identifier you wish as a single
        word. I have used <code>POLICY</code> in the example above as I am defining an IAM policy but you could have
        used anything like <code>&lt;&lt;STATEMENT</code> or <code>&lt;&lt;IAM</code>. You then start your multi line
        string on the next line and to finish it you use the opening identifier without the <code>&lt;&lt;</code>. <i>Note
            the closing marker must be at the start of a new line otherwise it is a syntax error.</i></p>

    <p>Inside the IAM policy we are using the S3 bucket data source. We are taking the arn from the S3 bucket so that we
        can use it in our IAM policy. You will notice that to get the value we are using the interpolation syntax <code>${data.aws_s3_bucket.bucket.arn}</code>.
        The opening <code>${</code> and closing <code>}</code> is needed because we are inside a multi line string so it
        is telling terraform that we want it to evaluate the value of this and not use it as a string literal. The
        format of a data source expression is <code>data.&lt;data_type&gt;.&lt;data_identifier&gt;.&lt;attribute_name&gt;</code>.
        You can get a full list of the attributes that a data resource provides from the documentation website of the
        provider.</p>

    <p>To run this project go to the terminal and cd into the folder where you created the <code>main.tf</code> file.
        Run <code>terraform init</code> to initialise Terraform and then <code>terraform apply</code>. When Terraform
        runs you will see that it only created a single resource, the IAM policy. This is because the S3 bucket we are
        using is created outside of Terraform.</p>

    <h2 id="leanpub-auto-how-are-data-sources-useful" class="section">How are data sources useful?</h2>

    <p>As your Terraform project gets large it can be sensible to break it up into smaller projects to make it easier to
        maintain. When this happens you can use data sources to reference resources created in other Terraform projects
        and still use them. In this case it would always be better to use a data source than to compute the arn yourself
        which would be possible with something like an S3 bucket. This is because you want Terraform to fail if for some
        reason the bucket no longer exists. By using a data source you get this behaviour. </p>

    <p>Imagine you want to create a new AWS EC2 instance using an AMI image from a private repository. You could hard
        code the name of the AMI image when creating the instance and then manually update it when a new AMI image is
        released. This would work but it would be quite cumbersome and would require a code change every time you wanted
        to use the latest version of the AMI image. By using a data source you could set it up so that it always reads
        the repository and gets the latest version of the AMI image when you run Terraform. You could then reference
        that data source when creating the EC2 instance and ensure that you always have the latest version of the
        image.</p>

    <p>Another reason you may want to use a data source is if you are migrating existing infrastructure to Terraform and
        you want to reference a resource that is not part of your Terraform project yet. As previously stated it is
        always better to use a data source rather than compute the value yourself. You want Terraform to know that there
        is a dependency on the resource. As you want your Terraform apply to fail if the resource cannot be found or if
        the attribute it returns changes then Terraform will realise when you run apply and update your project with the
        new value.</p>
