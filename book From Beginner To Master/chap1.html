        Terraform</h1>

    <h2 id="leanpub-auto-what-is-terraform" class="section">What is Terraform?</h2>

    <p>Terraform is a tool for building, changing, and versioning infrastructure safely and efficiently. It takes your
        infrastructure you have defined in code and makes it real! The beauty of what Terraform does is that it does not
        ask you how to get from the infrastructure you have to the infrastructure you want, it just asks you what you
        want the world to look like and then it does the hard work.</p>

    <p>If you are not very familiar with writing code then do not fret. The code that you have to write to configure
        Terraform is quite different from normal imperative code in languages such as Java or C#. So you can forget
        about classes and interfaces etc. Instead you can think of the code more as small blocks that represent
        something in the real world and then a set of properties for that resource to configure it. For example you
        create a block that represents an AWS EC2 instance and then you can set the properties to say the type of
        instance you want and the AMI image you want. You do not need to tell Terraform how to do what you want or how
        to get from what you have now to what you want as you would in an imperative language. All you have to do is
        tell Terraform what you want and that’s it!</p>

    <p>Let’s walk through a small example: </p>

    <p>In your Terraform project you have defined that you want 4 AWS EC2 instances. If you currently have no EC2
        instances then when you run Terraform then it will create 4 AWS EC2 instances for you. If you have 3 EC2
        instances when you run Terraform then Terraform will only create 1 additional instance and leave the 3 you
        already had. If you have 5 AWS EC2 Instances, Terraform will delete one. At no point does Terraform ask you how
        many instances you currently had, Terraform figured it out and then created a plan on how to get from what you
        have to what you want and then made it happen. This may seem trivial in this example but think about the power
        that gives you when you extrapolate that out over a whole environment.</p>

    <p>Now that we know what Terraform is, lets discuss some of the common problems that occur when you manage your
        infrastructure by hand and don’t use Terraform.</p>

    <h2 id="leanpub-auto-issues-with-configuring-infrastructure-manually" class="section">Issues with configuring
        infrastructure manually</h2>

    <p>How many times have you worked at a company where every environment (Dev, QAT, Staging, Production etc) has its
        own personality. You try and test a feature on QAT and you hear “oh that never works on QAT we will have to
        check that on staging” or “Production is the only environment with a load balancer so that’s why we never
        spotted the bug before”. When humans are responsible for keeping environments in sync, things fall between the
        cracks and the environments drift apart. It is also a lot of manual work to constantly apply changes to each
        environment. Having environments with different infrastructure causes a number of issues such as you only find
        bugs on a certain environment and make development hard as you are never testing against production like
        infrastructure.</p>

    <p>Configuring infrastructure manually is very error prone. If you want to try out a new infrastructure
        configuration then you have to make the change to an environment by hand. If the change is what you want then
        you have to remember what steps are involved to make the change and then manually apply them to all of your
        other environments. If you do not like the change then you have to remember how to roll the environment back to
        how it was. As the process is manual, often the changes are not made exactly the same to each environment which
        is one of the reasons that environments end up differing and have their own personalities. </p>

    <p>It is very time consuming to make the changes manually. If you have several environments and the change is quite
        complex it can take days to roll that change to each environment.</p>

    <p>Once you have an environment when you come to no longer need it destroying it can be very painful. For starters
        you have to destroy the infrastructure in the correct order as often you cannot destroy a piece of
        infrastructure if another piece depends on it. You end up becoming a human dependency tree calculator. After a
        lot of pain you finally think that you have finished destroying the environment only to get a bill from your
        cloud provider the following month for that piece of infrastructure that you accidentally left running.</p>

    <h2 id="leanpub-auto-terraform-to-the-rescue" class="section">Terraform to the rescue</h2>

    <p>Terraform solves all of these problems because your infrastructure is defined in code. The code represents the
        state of your infrastructure. When your run Terraform against your code it will update your environment to be
        exactly how you have specified it in code. Reproducible every time. The machine prospers where humans fail. All
        of your environments are identical!</p>

    <p>Terraform can make all of the changes to your environment very quickly. No longer do you have to wait for days
        whilst someone follows the run book by hand. A change is made to the code, merged and then instantly can get
        Terraform to update every environment simultaneously to include the new change.</p>

    <p>As your infrastructure is now defined in code you can check it into source control. This means that you can make
        a change to your code, roll it into an environment using Terraform and try it out. If the change is no good then
        you can simply go back to the previous version of the code in source control and run Terraform again. Then
        Terraform handles putting the environment back to how it was. If the change is good then you can check that into
        source control and roll it into all of your other environments.</p>

    <p>Having your infrastructure in code has another major benefit. You can now easily create multiple instances of the
        same configuration (multiple environments). All of the instances can be created quickly and all will be
        identical. Being able to create multiple identical environments is a big competitive advantage as it means that
        each team can have their own environment, you could even have one per person if you wanted! You know that the
        environment you are testing your software on is exactly the same as production. So there are no sudden surprises
        due to environment drift!</p>

    <p>Terraform is actually split into two parts. One part is the Terraform engine that knows how to get from the state
        your infrastructure is currently in to how you want your infrastructure to be. The other part is the provider
        which is the part that talks to the infrastructure to find out the current state and make the changes using the
        infrastructure’s API. Due to the clever way Terraform is split there are providers available for just about
        everything you can think of. Meaning you can use Terraform to configure infrastructure in AWS, Azure, GCP,
        Oracle Cloud Platform and just about any other cloud you can think of. It can also be used to configure a huge
        variety of other components that make up your environment such as Kong, Postgres, Runscope, Auth0, Couchbase,
        TeamCity you name it there is probably a provider for it. Plus if there is not a provider for it then the really
        cool part is that you can write your own and then use that in your project.</p>

    <p>This means that in a single project you can configure multiple components and infrastructure that sits in
        multiple clouds. All using the same language (HCL) and all in the same project sitting together. This is such a
        powerful concept that you can define every aspect of your environment all in the same project and Terraform can
        work out the order to run and configure each component for you so you do not have to worry about that.</p>

    <p>Terraform uses a language called Hashicorp Markup Language or HCL as it known. HCL as you will see is a very
        simple, easy to read syntax that is completely understandable even to someone looking at it for the first time.
        This makes it straight forward to read through the code that defines the environment and work out what it is
        going to do.</p>

    <p>Terraform has a massive online community. Having a big online community means that help is never far away.
        Chances are if you have a problem then you will be able to find the solution from the community. The community
        also contribute to the providers which is a big reason as to why there is a provider for almost every service
        you can think of. As the providers are often open source you can raise issues you find on the provider
        repository and get answers on any issues from the provider author themselves. Often bugs and issues get fixed
        quickly. You can even fix the provider yourself and run a local fixed build if you need the provider fixed
        straight away. Due to the way providers are built and run they are normally very quick to encompass new changes
        to an infrastructure API.</p>

    <p>Terraform allows you to see what it is going to do (plan) and await your confirmation before it actually makes
        any changes. This is a great safety net in case you made a change that you did not mean. It gives you an insight
        into how Terraform will update your environment to match your desired state (we will cover Terraform plans in
        much more detail in the book).</p>

    <p>With Terraform you can destroy a whole environment and be guaranteed that you are left with nothing. Meaning no
        more unwanted bill for that piece of infrastructure you forgot to delete. Terraform can calculate the dependency
        order that infrastructure needs to be deleted in so that it can delete it in the correct order. All
        automatically and very quickly.</p>

    <p>Terraform has a solution if you already have infrastructure and you want to start using Terraform to manage it.
        You can do this by importing your infrastructure into Terraform. This is great as it allows you to move your
        infrastructure from being manually setup to being defined in code. </p>

    <h2 id="leanpub-auto-why-not-just-use-cloudformation" class="section">Why not just use CloudFormation?</h2>

    <p>As this book is going to use AWS for examples I thought it would be prudent to address the question: <i>Why use
        Terraform over CloudFormation?</i> As CloudFormation is an infrastructure as code tool that is doing the same
        job and it is written by Amazon themselves so surely it is better? Well not exactly. There are a number of
        reasons why Terraform is a much better choice than CloudFormation for your project.</p>

    <p>Terraform is open source and generally moves faster than CloudFormation. Even though CloudFormation is produced
        by Amazon it can still take a while for a new AWS feature to appear in CloudFormation believe it or not! Whereas
        the community are amazing at keeping Terraform up to date. This is aided by the fact that each Terraform
        provider (think of that as a plugin to manage a certain vendor or component) is a separate binary that gets
        deployed at its own speed (we will cover providers in detail later in the book). </p>

    <p>CloudFormation uses JSON or YAML for configuration. Both of these formats are flawed in my view for different
        reasons. JSON can be quite tricky to read when you have a big object and fiddly to get right due to all of the
        curly braces. JSON does not allow comments either which means if you want to put a note on something to explain
        it then you cannot do that. YAML does allow comments and is a bit less verbose than JSON. The big downside of
        YAML (and anyone that has used it will contest to this) is that YAML is very very fussy about correct
        indentation. It can have you pulling your hair out trying to get right. If you want to remove a block in the
        middle of your YAML file it is a nightmare trying to get the indentation correct again. YAML is also hard to
        follow when you have a large file. It is hard to read it as a human quickly and work out what is going on. </p>

    <p>Terraform uses HCL, which has a clean concise syntax. It is very easy to read, allows comments (both inline and
        block) and is not fussy about spacing, newlines or indentation. That is not to say you cannot use a formatter or
        an IDE to get it looking neat, it is just that it is not a syntax error if you add an extra space as it can be
        with YAML. Using HCL you can easily split your project up into multiple files as you see fit. To make the code
        easier to read and understand when coming to the project.</p>

    <p>The killer feature that makes Terraform the obvious choice over CloudFormation is that you can use Terraform to
        configure all of your infrastructure whereas you can only use CloudFormation for AWS. This means that you can
        have one tool and project to manage all of your infrastructure. Even if your infrastructure is made up of
        several components and split across multiple clouds. You can even write your own Terraform provider if you want
        to configure something that is not currently supported by Terraform. Meaning that you can use Terraform to
        configure absolutely everything. If you are using CloudFormation then if you want to configure anything other
        than AWS then you have to use a different tool for that.</p>

    <h2 id="leanpub-auto-what-about-chef-and-puppet-dont-they-solve-this-problem" class="section">What about Chef and
        Puppet, don’t they solve this problem?</h2>

    <p>Chef and Puppet are configuration management tools. They are designed to configure and manage software that is
        running on a machine (infrastructure) that already exists. Whereas Terraform sits at the abstraction layer above
        that and is designed to setup all of the infrastructure that make up your system such as load balancers,
        servers, DNS records etc. </p>

    <p>As a small aside it is possible to configure software already running on a machine through Terraform using
        provisioners but this should be used with caution and it is best to leave this type of configuration to
        specialised tools like Puppet and Chef. <i>Provisioners and their use case will be covered later in the book</i>.
