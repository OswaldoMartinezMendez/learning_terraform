    <h2 id="leanpub-auto-layout" class="section">Layout</h2>

    <p>Up until now we have been creating several Terraform projects to get used to different concepts we have been
        learning. But in every project we have been creating a single file called <code>main.tf</code> where we have
        placed all of our Terraform code (HCL). You may have wondered why all of the code was in a single file and what
        was the significance of that? Terraform actually does not care what the name of the file is, as long as it ends
        in <code>.tf</code>. So in all of the projects so far we could have called the file <code>project.tf</code>,
        <code>code.tf</code> or <code>foo.tf</code>. It really does not matter.</p>

    <p>We can also split the code over as many files as we wish. The only rule is that all of the files have to be in
        the same folder because folders have a significance in Terraform (as we will learn in the next chapter on
        modules). The top level folder we have been working in is considered the main Terraform project. All files at
        the level (directly in that folder) are considered to be part of the project.</p>

    <p>So if we have the following folder structure on disk:</p>


    <figure class="code " dir="ltr">
        <figcaption></figcaption>
        <div class="highlight"><pre><code></code><code class="lineno">1 </code>/project
<code class="lineno">2 </code>    main.tf
</pre>
        </div>

    </figure>


    <p>Then inside <code>main.tf</code> we had the code as we had in our first Terraform project:</p>


    <figure class="code " dir="ltr">
        <figcaption></figcaption>
        <div class="highlight"><pre><code></code><code class="lineno">1 </code>provider "aws" {
<code class="lineno">2 </code>  region = "eu-west-1"
<code class="lineno">3 </code>}
<code class="lineno">4 </code>
<code class="lineno">5 </code>resource "aws_s3_bucket" "first_bucket" {
<code class="lineno">6 </code>  bucket = "&lt;yourname&gt;-first-bucket"
<code class="lineno">7 </code>}
</pre>
        </div>

    </figure>


    <p>Then Terraform will consider that we are setting up the AWS provider and creating a single S3 bucket. Now if we
        change our project folder structure to the following:</p>


    <figure class="code " dir="ltr">
        <figcaption></figcaption>
        <div class="highlight"><pre><code></code><code class="lineno">1 </code>/project
<code class="lineno">2 </code>    provider.tf
<code class="lineno">3 </code>    s3.tf
</pre>
        </div>

    </figure>


    <p>Then in the <code>provider.tf</code> file we place the following code:</p>


    <figure class="code " dir="ltr">
        <figcaption></figcaption>
        <div class="highlight"><pre><code></code><code class="lineno">1 </code>provider "aws" {
<code class="lineno">2 </code>  region = "eu-west-1"
<code class="lineno">3 </code>}
</pre>
        </div>

    </figure>


    <p>In <code>s3.tf</code> we place the S3 bucket creation:</p>


    <figure class="code " dir="ltr">
        <figcaption></figcaption>
        <div class="highlight"><pre><code></code><code class="lineno">1 </code>resource "aws_s3_bucket" "first_bucket" {
<code class="lineno">2 </code>  bucket = "&lt;yourname&gt;-first-bucket"
<code class="lineno">3 </code>}
</pre>
        </div>

    </figure>


    <p>Then if we ran Terraform again with the files in this structure Terraform would not show any difference.
        Terraform would still create a single S3 bucket. A good way to think about this is that when you run Terraform,
        it combines all of the code from all of the files in the top level folder together (in this case
        <code>/project</code>) and makes them into a single big text block. It then works out what you have defined in
        that block and the original filenames are thrown away.</p>

    <p>Even though this means we are free to name the files and organise our code as we wish there are some conventions
        the community follow that make it easier to move from one Terraform project to another. Generally providers are
        setup in a file called <code>main.tf</code>. This gives you a place to look as to where all providers are
        configured. Files are then normally broken up around different areas of the system. For example if we are
        creating an AWS ECS cluster, we could put all of the setup for that cluster in a file called <code>ecs.tf</code>.
        If we are configuring our DNS entries in route53 we could put that in a file called <code>dns.tf</code>. The
        important point is to layout the code as to how it makes the most sense for you and the people you are working
        on the project with.</p>

    <p>One last thing to cover on project structure is what happens when you create a child folder and put some code in
        there? Lets update the project above and add a child folder so our project structure now looks like:</p>


    <figure class="code " dir="ltr">
        <figcaption></figcaption>
        <div class="highlight"><pre><code></code><code class="lineno">1 </code>/project
<code class="lineno">2 </code>    provider.tf
<code class="lineno">3 </code>    s3.tf
<code class="lineno">4 </code>    other/
<code class="lineno">5 </code>        bucket.tf
</pre>
        </div>

    </figure>


    <p>Then inside the file <code>bucket.tf</code> place the following code:</p>


    <figure class="code " dir="ltr">
        <figcaption></figcaption>
        <div class="highlight"><pre><code></code><code class="lineno">1 </code>resource "aws_s3_bucket" "other" {
<code class="lineno">2 </code>  bucket = "&lt;yourname&gt;-other-bucket"
<code class="lineno">3 </code>}
</pre>
        </div>

    </figure>


    <p>If you run Terraform by running <code>terraform init</code> and then <code>terraform apply</code> from inside the
        <code>project/</code> folder you will see the Terraform runs and creates one S3 bucket. It completely ignores
        the code inside <code>bucket.tf</code>. That is because it is in a sub folder and only the code in the top level
        folder is considered by Terraform. <i>Note if you want to get the code for the last example then it is in the
            folder <code>project_layout_example_01</code> in the examples repository</i>.</p>
