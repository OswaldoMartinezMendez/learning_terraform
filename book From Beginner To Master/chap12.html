    <h2 id="leanpub-auto-plans" class="section">Plans</h2>

    <p>A plan is Terraform showing you how it needs to change the world to get it into the desired state specified in
        your code. Terraform plans, detail you what Terraform will create, what Terraform will destroy and what
        Terraform will update. This gives you a view on what Terraform is going to do before you ask Terraform to do it.
        Terraform summarises how many creates, updates and destroys it is going to do at the bottom of the plan.</p>

    <p>So far in this book we have been running <code>terraform apply</code> which will automatically do a plan first
        and then pause and wait for you to confirm. When Terraform pauses it is giving you time to review the plan to
        make sure it is correct before executing it. In this chapter we are going to learn how to read plans and some
        key things to look out for.</p>

    <p>Lets create a small project so we can explore how plans work. Create a new folder in your workspace and create a
        single file in the folder called <code>main.tf</code> and paste in the following code (or if you are using the
        examples from GitHub then the folder with the code is <code>plans_example_01</code>):</p>


    <figure class="code " dir="ltr">
        <figcaption></figcaption>
        <div class="highlight"><pre><code></code><code class="lineno">1 </code>provider "aws" {
<code class="lineno">2 </code>  region  = "eu-west-1"
<code class="lineno">3 </code>  version = "~&gt; 2.27"
<code class="lineno">4 </code>}
<code class="lineno">5 </code>
<code class="lineno">6 </code>resource "aws_sqs_queue" "test_queue" {
<code class="lineno">7 </code>  name = "test_queue"
<code class="lineno">8 </code>}
</pre>
        </div>

    </figure>


    <p>By now you should be able to understand what the HCL above is going to do, it is going to setup the AWS provider
        and create a queue with the name <code>test_queue</code>. Open your terminal and go into the folder where you
        have created the project and run <code>terraform init</code> to initialise Terraform and then <code>terraform
            apply</code> but do not confirm just yet.</p>

    <p>You should see a plan that looks something like this:</p>


    <figure class="code " dir="ltr">

        </div>

    </figure>


    <p>The plan above is going to create a single SQS queue (as we were expecting). Everything that Terraform is going
        to create is marked with a <code>+</code> symbol. The line <code>+ resource "aws_sqs_queue" "test_queue"</code>
        is showing that Terraform is going to create a new resource. Because of this every attribute is also marked with
        <code>+</code> which may be obvious when you are creating a new resource but the attribute markings will be more
        important later on.</p>

    <p>At the bottom of the plan is the summary <code>Plan: 1 to add, 0 to change, 0 to destroy.</code>. In the summary
        Terraform adds up all of the resources it is going to create (add), update (change) and destroy. It is good
        practice to look at this line first and consider whether any of the numbers look completely wrong. For example
        if you are expecting to be creating some new resources and Terraform says <code>0 to add, 4 to change, 4 to
            destroy</code> then Terraform will not be creating anything and you will want to review the plan carefully.
    </p>

    <p>The plan above is what we are expecting so lets confirm it by typing <code>yes</code> and pressing enter.</p>

    <p>Once Terraform has applied those changes update the <code>aws_sqs_queue</code> resource to the following (code is
        in <code>plans_example_02</code> folder in the examples repository if you want to paste it in from there <i>note
            you will have to copy the code across you cannot use a new folder otherwise Terraform will consider it a
            different project</i>):</p>

<code class="lineno">4 </code>}
</pre>
        </div>

    <p>Now run <code>terraform apply</code> again and you should see a plan like:</p>

        </div>

    </figure>


    <p>Notice this time the resource is marked with <code>~</code> which means the resource will be updated in place. An
        update in place means the resource can be updated without destroying it and recreating it. It is important to
        spot when an update can happen in place which is generally safe and when a resource has to be destroyed first
        and then recreated (we will cover this case soon). The <code>~</code> symbol is next to the <code>visibility_timeout_seconds</code>
        attribute showing that this attribute will be changed if you confirm this apply. You can see that the value is
        changing from <code>30</code> to <code>45</code>.</p>

    <p>Apply this plan by typing <code>yes</code> and pressing enter. This will now modify the queue so that it has a
        visibility timeout of <code>45</code> seconds.</p>

    <p>Update the <code>aws_sqs_queue</code> resource again with the following code (or you can get the code example
        from the folder <code>plans_example_03</code> in the examples repository <i>note you will have to copy the code
            across you cannot use a new folder otherwise Terraform will consider it a different project</i>):</p>

</pre>
        </div>

    </figure>


    <p>We are changing the name of the SQS queue from <code>test_queue</code> to <code>my_queue</code>. In AWS there is
        no way to change the name of a SQS queue once it is created. To do this you have to destroy your old queue and
        create a new one. Lets see how Terraform handles the update we have made to our code. Run <code>terraform
            apply</code> and view the plan which should look something like this:</p>

    <p>The symbol next to the <code>aws_sqs_queue</code> is <code>-/+</code>. This is a special type of update where
        Terraform has to destroy your resource and then create a new one in order to make the change. It is important to
        note that destroy then creates are potentially dangerous as it means your resource may not be available for a
        period of time, so this type of change should applied with caution. At the bottom, the summary of the plan
        states <code>1 to add, 0 to change, 1 to destroy</code> which shows that we are destroying the resource and then
        recreating it, even though all we did was update the name of the queue.</p>

    <p>When you apply the change above there will be a period of time where no SQS queue will exist. As what Terraform
        will do is first destroy the old queue and only once the queue is destroyed will it then create the new one. If
        you want Terraform to create the new queue before deleting the old one then this is possible using a resource
        lifecycle which will be covered in a later chapter. As a small aside if you want to change the name of an SQS
        queue then a better technique would be to create a new SQS queue in one release so both queues exist side by
        side, then switch your application over to using the new queue. Then do another Terraform release to delete the
        original queue.</p>

    <p>Take the <code>main.tf</code> file and remove the <code>aws_sqs_queue</code> resource (or you can get the code
        example from the folder <code>plans_example_04</code> in the examples repository <i>note you will have to copy
            the code across you cannot use a new folder otherwise Terraform will consider it a different project</i>).
    </p>

    <p>Run <code>terraform apply</code> and this time you will see a plan such as:</p>

</pre>
        </div>

    </figure>


    <p>As we have removed the SQS queue from our Terraform code you will see that Terraform wants to remove the SQS
        queue from AWS. The <code>-</code> symbol next to the <code>aws_sqs_queue</code> resource depicts the fact that
        Terraform wants to destroy the resource. The summary of the plan also shows that Terraform has 1 item to
        destroy.</p>

    <p>Destroys and destroy then creates are the key thing to look out for when reviewing a Terraform plan. As both of
        them mean that you are going to destroy a resource. Once the resource is destroyed any state that was part of
        the resource could be lost and obviously if you delete a key part of your infrastructure you could cause an
        outage.</p>

    <p>When reviewing a plan a good mindset to get into is to think about the changes you have made to your Terraform
        code and see if the plan matches what you are expecting. Start with the summary and see if you are seeing
        roughly the right amount of adds, updates and destroys and then work up from there. When changing a resource
        property carefully check whether that is going to result in Terraform needing to destroy and then recreate that
        resource in order to make that change. If you find the documentation for the resource it will say <code>force_create</code>
        next to the attributes that will cause a destroy then create if they are changed. This is what we saw in the SQS
        example we went through where we updated the name.</p>

    <h2 id="leanpub-auto-plan-command" class="section">Plan command</h2>

    <p>Until now we have been taking advantage of the fact that when you run the command <code>terraform apply</code> by
        default it does a plan first and pauses for you to confirm before actually doing the apply. It is however
        possible just to get Terraform to do a plan without the option of applying it. To do this simply run the command
        <code>terraform plan</code>. A Terraform plan will produce a plan as we have seen before but it will not give
        you the option to apply it, instead it will just show you the plan. This command can be useful if you want to
        just test the water with something and do not want to run the risk of applying it by accident. It can also be
        useful when building Terraform deployment pipelines as we discuss below.</p>

    <p>Lets go through an example of using the Terraform plan command. Go back to the example from the project <code>plans_example_01</code>
        in the code examples repository or use the following <code>main.tf</code> code:</p>


    <figure class="code " dir="ltr">
        <figcaption></figcaption>
        <div class="highlight"><pre><code></code><code class="lineno">1 </code>provider "aws" {
<code class="lineno">2 </code>  region = "eu-west-1"
<code class="lineno">3 </code>}
<code class="lineno">4 </code>
<code class="lineno">5 </code>resource "aws_sqs_queue" "test_queue" {
<code class="lineno">6 </code>  name = "test_queue"
<code class="lineno">7 </code>}
</pre>
        </div>

    </figure>


    <p>Open your terminal and go into the folder where the <code>main.tf</code> file is located and run <code>terraform
        plan</code>. Terraform will show you the same plan as we saw at the start of this chapter. You can save the plan
        that Terraform generates to a file by using the <code>-out</code> parameter. Lets try the plan again and this
        time save it to a file called <code>myplan</code> by using the command <code>terraform plan -out myplan</code>.
    </p>

    <p>You may be wondering what you can do with the plan that you have saved to a file. Well you can use the plan you
        just saved with the apply command, to apply that plan to your infrastructure. Try running the following command
        <code>terraform apply myplan</code>. Terraform will just apply your plan saved in the file <code>myplan</code>
        without stopping to ask you if you wanted to do it or not. The reason being is that by running apply in this way
        you have broken the <code>terraform apply</code> command into two phases: the plan phase and the apply phase.
        Because you saved the plan to a file and you pass that plan to apply you are saying to Terraform that this is
        the plan I want you to execute in the apply.</p>

    <p>Remember to finish up by destroying the resources by running <code>terraform destroy</code> and confirming by
        typing <code>yes</code> and pressing enter.</p>

    <p>Being able to separate out the plan and apply phase enables you to write your own build deploy pipelines by
        having the plan as a step and then passing that plan file onto the apply step. This gives you the option to
        pause if you want and allow a human operator to check the plan before you pass it to be applied.</p>

    <h2 id="leanpub-auto-auto-apply" class="section">Auto apply</h2>

    <p>It is possible to skip the confirmation where Terraform pauses during the apply phase a different way, you can
        use the <code>-auto-approve</code> flag. Lets test this out by ysing the same Terraform code again (from the
        repository folder <code>plans_example_01</code>) run the command <code>terraform apply -auto-approve</code>.
        Terraform will simply create the AWS SQS queue without stopping to ask you to confirm. <i>Remember to destroy
            these resources once you have run the example</i>.</p>

    <p>I wanted to show the <code>-auto-approve</code> flag in order to highlight a key difference between using that
        and passing a plan to the <code>apply</code> command which also causes apply to run without asking for you to
        confirm. The difference is that when you pass a plan to the apply command, the apply command will execute that
        exact plan. So if something has changed in your infrastructure and that plan is no longer possible then
        Terraform will error and tell you. It is a safe guard where you are explicitly saying to Terraform, go and
        execute exactly this plan. Whereas with the auto apply flag you are saying to Terraform go and work out what to
        do, generate a plan and then just go and do it without asking you to confirm. For this reason using the <code>-auto-approve</code>
        flag is much more dangerous and not really recommended in most scenarios, as if Terraform is going to destroy
        your database it is just going to go ahead and do it without asking you to confirm.</p>

    <p>This is the reason that if you are building Terraform into a build deploy pipeline you want to use a plan file
        and pass it to apply. As it allows you to review the plan and then know for sure that Terraform will only be
        executing exactly the plan that you reviewed.</p>
