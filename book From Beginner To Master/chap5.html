    <h2 id="leanpub-auto-providers-in-detail" class="section">Providers in detail</h2>

    <p>A provider in Terraform is a connection that allows Terraform to manage infrastructure using a pre defined
        interface. This abstraction is very powerful as it means the Terraform engine which understands how to read
        state from a provider, read HCL code and then work out how to get to the desired state, is completely separate
        from the provider. It allows anyone to write a provider to connect to anything (as long as there is a
        programmable way to talk to it). All the provider writer has to do for each resource they want to allow
        Terraform to control is provide Terraform with a way to create it, read it and delete it. <b>Note update is
            actually optional as Terraform can always delete and then create the resource if update is not provided</b>.
    </p>

    <p>Due to the provider model that Terraform employs, providers are not part of the main Terraform source code. They
        are separate binaries that live in their own repositories and can move at their own speed. This means that if a
        provider needs to release a bug fix or new feature they can just release it. They do not need to coordinate a
        release of the main Terraform code base.</p>

    <p>A provider is defined using a provider block. You have already used a provider block in the examples so far in
        this book, it looks like:</p>


    <figure class="code " dir="ltr">
        <figcaption></figcaption>
        <div class="highlight"><pre><code></code><code class="lineno">1 </code>provider "aws" {
<code class="lineno">2 </code>  region = "eu-west-1"
<code class="lineno">3 </code>}
</pre>
        </div>

    </figure>


    <p>The provider block is very simple it starts with the keyword <code>provider</code> to indicate that this is a
        provider block. You then have to give the name of the provider that you are using. In this case we are using the
        <code>aws</code> provider so we put <code>"aws"</code>. You then use a <code>{</code> to open the provider
        block. Inside the provider block you can put all of the configuration you want for the provider. For the AWS
        provider the only property that we are configuring is the region. This will be the region that we are going to
        create our AWS resources in. You then end the provider block with a closing <code>}</code>.</p>

    <p>Create a new folder and inside that folder create a file called <code>main.tf</code> and place only the above
        provider block in that file (folder <code>providers_example_01</code> in the example repository if you want to
        copy the code). Go to the command line and navigate to the new project that you created and run <code>terraform
            init</code>. You will notice that Terraform downloads the AWS provider automatically, you will see <code>Downloading
            plugin for provider "aws" (hashicorp/aws) 2.27.0...</code>. You may be wondering how that happens? Hashicorp
        (the company who make Terraform) host a registry which contains the most popular providers. If the provider that
        you use is in the registry then all you have to do to use it is define a provider block that sets up that
        provider and run <code>terraform init</code> to download it. You can see a full list of providers that are in
        the registry on the Hashicorp Terraform site: https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/index.html. </p>

    <p>You may be wondering where Terraform puts this provider? It puts it inside the project where you are currently
        working in a special folder called <code>.terraform</code>. The relative path on my Macbook to the AWS provider
        that gets downloaded when I run <code>terraform init</code> is <code>.terraform/plugins/darwin_amd64/terraform-provider-aws_v2.27.0_x4</code>.
        The platform part (3rd folder in) may vary for you depending on the platform you are running on. The provider is
        actually a separate binary which Terraform calls out to at run time to do its work. As an interesting aside the
        name of the provider binary is always in the format <code>terraform-provider-&lt;NAME&gt;_vX.Y.Z</code>.
        Terraform uses this convention to search for providers on your machine, so that it knows if you have a
        particular version of a provider when you run <code>terraform init</code>. It uses this information to know
        whether or not to download it.</p>

    <h2 id="leanpub-auto-provider-best-practices" class="section">Provider best practices</h2>

    <p>When you ran <code>terraform init</code> you may have noticed the warning message that Terraform printed out
        where it said that it recommends that you use a version constraint on the provider.</p>

    <p>To fix this create a new Terraform project by creating a new folder and creating a single file called <code>main.tf</code>
        and placing the following code inside (or grab the code inside <code>providers_example_02</code> from the
        examples repository):</p>


    <figure class="code " dir="ltr">
        <figcaption></figcaption>
        <div class="highlight"><pre><code></code><code class="lineno">1 </code>provider "aws" {
<code class="lineno">2 </code>  region  = "eu-west-1"
<code class="lineno">3 </code>  version = "~&gt; 2.27"
<code class="lineno">4 </code>}
</pre>
        </div>

    </figure>


    <p>Go to your terminal and go into the folder you have created and run <code>terraform init</code>. You will see
        that Terraform downloads the AWS provider but this time there will not be a warning given about the version
        constraint. The version constraint <code>~&gt; 2.27</code> means any minor version higher is ok to upgrade to
        but no major version and no beta versions. It effectively means any version up to but not including
        <code>3.0.0</code> is ok. Every time you run <code>terraform init</code> Terraform will go up to the registry
        and check what the latest version is of all of the providers you have defined. It will then look on your machine
        and see what version you have installed. If you have no version constraint on the provider then you are saying
        to Terraform that you always want Terraform to download the latest version. This can be dangerous (as the
        warning message tells you) as it will mean that Terraform will get the latest version even if it is a major
        version update which means it will contain breaking changes. Therefore you should always use a version
        constraint on the provider to ensure that Terraform will not upgrade the provider to a new major version. Minor
        version updates are ok as they will not contain a breaking change. So in our example if version <code>2.3</code>
        gets released Terraform will upgrade our project to that version of the provider when we next run <code>terraform
            init</code>.</p>

    <p>The general advice is to use <code>~&gt; X.YY</code> notation for your provider. Which will give the semantics
        described above, which is generally what you want. If you are unsure of what to specify then leave off the
        version parameter, run <code>terraform init</code>. Once Terraform downloads the provider it will tell you what
        version it has downloaded in the output. Then put the version of the provider it has downloaded after <code>~&gt;</code>
        in the version constraint.</p>

    <p>Terraform is quite flexible on what you can do with the version constraint as the below list shows:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>
            <code>&gt;= 1.2.0</code>: version 1.2.0 or newer
        </li>
        <li>
            <code>&lt;= 1.2.0</code>: version 1.2.0 or older
        </li>
        <li>
            <code>~&gt; 1.2.0</code>: any non-beta version &gt;= 1.2.0 and &lt; 1.3.0, e.g. 1.2.X
        </li>
        <li>
            <code>~&gt; 1.2</code>: any non-beta version &gt;= 1.2.0 and &lt; 2.0.0, e.g. 1.X.Y
        </li>
        <li>
            <code>&gt;= 1.0.0</code>, &lt;= 2.0.0: any version between 1.0.0 and 2.0.0 inclusive
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="leanpub-auto-more-than-one-instance-of-the-same-provider" class="section">More than one instance of the same
        provider</h2>

    <p>On the AWS provider as <code>region</code> is a required parameter you may be wondering how you create resources
        in different regions and if that is possible in a single Terraform project? Well yes it is. To do this you
        simply create multiple instances of the same provider. </p>

    <p>Create a Terraform project on your machine by creating a new folder and creating a single file in that folder
        called <code>main.tf</code> (or grab the project from the <code>providers_example_03</code> folder in the
        examples repository), then copy in the following code:</p>


    <figure class="code " dir="ltr">
        <figcaption></figcaption>
        <div class="highlight"><pre><code></code><code class="lineno"> 1 </code>provider "aws" {
<code class="lineno"> 2 </code>  region  = "eu-west-1"
<code class="lineno"> 3 </code>  version = "~&gt; 2.27"
<code class="lineno"> 4 </code>}
<code class="lineno"> 5 </code>
<code class="lineno"> 6 </code>provider "aws" {
<code class="lineno"> 7 </code>  region  = "eu-west-2"
<code class="lineno"> 8 </code>  alias   = "london"
<code class="lineno"> 9 </code>  version = "~&gt; 2.27"
<code class="lineno">10 </code>}
<code class="lineno">11 </code>
<code class="lineno">12 </code>resource "aws_vpc" "ireland_vpc" {
<code class="lineno">13 </code>  cidr_block = "10.0.0.0/16"
<code class="lineno">14 </code>}
<code class="lineno">15 </code>
<code class="lineno">16 </code>resource "aws_vpc" "london_vpc" {
<code class="lineno">17 </code>  cidr_block = "10.1.0.0/16"
<code class="lineno">18 </code>  provider   = "aws.london"
<code class="lineno">19 </code>}
</pre>
        </div>

    </figure>


    <p>As you can see we are defining two instances of the AWS provider. The once pointing at the region
        <code>eu-west-1</code> and once at the region <code>eu-west-2</code>. For the one that is pointing at <code>eu-west-2</code>
        you will notice that we are setting the <code>alias</code> property to <code>london</code>. Alias is a property
        you can set on any provider block, it is no way special to the aws provider. What this gives us is a way to
        distinguish between the two providers. Once you define two or more instances of the same provider every
        definition after the first must have an alias set.</p>

    <p>After we have defined the two AWS providers we are creating a VPC called <code>ireland_vpc</code>, with the CIDR
        block <code>10.0.0.0/16</code>. As we have not told Terraform which provider instance to use for this resource
        Terraform will pick the instance of the AWS provider where you have not defined an alias. Which means that this
        VPC will be created in the region <code>eu-west-1</code> (Ireland). The second VPC we have defined with the
        identifier <code>london_vpc</code> has a CIDR block of <code>10.1.0.0/16</code>. This time we have set the
        <code>provider</code> property on the resource to <code>aws.london</code>. This means that terraform will use
        our second AWS provider which points to the region <code>eu-west-2</code>, so when we run the project by doing
        <code>terraform apply</code> this VPC will be created in <code>eu-west-2</code>.</p>

    <p>Every resource has a <code>provider</code> property that you can set. The format of the value is set by <code>&lt;provider_name&gt;.&lt;provider_alias&gt;</code>.
        For our example when we created the VPC in london we were using the AWS provider and the alias was london hence
        we set the provider property to <code>aws.london</code>. </p>

    <p>You be wondering if there is a way to explicitly tell Terraform to use the default provider even though you do
        not need to. To do that you can set the <code>provider</code> property to the provider name. So for example we
        could have defined the <code>ireland_vpc</code>:</p>


    <figure class="code " dir="ltr">
        <figcaption></figcaption>
        <div class="highlight"><pre><code></code><code class="lineno">1 </code>resource "aws_vpc" "ireland_vpc" {
<code class="lineno">2 </code>  cidr_block = "10.0.0.0/16"
<code class="lineno">3 </code>  provider   = "aws"
<code class="lineno">4 </code>}
</pre>
        </div>

    </figure>


    <p>This would have given us exactly the same output. Due to this being extra code for no added value no one in the
        community writes their HCL in this way. Less is more, and it is cleaner and easier to read if you omit the
        provider property when using the default provider instance.</p>

    <p>To run the above project go to a terminal and change into the directory where you have placed the
        <code>main.tf</code> file. Run <code>terraform init</code> to initialise the project and download the AWS
        provider. Next run <code>terraform apply</code> then confirm by typing <code>yes</code> and pressing enter. This
        will create the two VPCs, one in <code>eu-west-1</code> and one in <code>eu-west-2</code>. Log into the AWS
        Console and navigate to find the VPC section. Switch into the <code>eu-west-1</code> and <code>eu-west-2</code>
        regions and you will see the VPCs that Terraform created. Once you are done with the project do not forget to
        run <code>terraform destroy</code> and then confirm with <code>yes</code> to delete all of the resources in this
        project.</p>
